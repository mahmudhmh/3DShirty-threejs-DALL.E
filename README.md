## Overview

This project aims to build a visually engaging website that showcases 3D graphics of t-shirt models using the power of ThreeJS and React. The website utilizes React Three Fiber, a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React, to render and animate the 3D models. The overall styling of the website is achieved using TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to ensure a modern and responsive design. To bring the website to life with stunning animations, the Framer Motion library is utilized.

## Features

- Load, create, and customize captivating 3D models and geometries with the use of various lights, providing an immersive user experience.
- Understand the 3D world with a camera and effectively position objects in the 3D space to create visually appealing scenes.
- Implement reusable code and ensure scalability using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices, resulting in a maintainable codebase.
- Enable custom color and file support, allowing users to personalize their experience on the website.
- Utilize DALLE AI to generate and incorporate images, enhancing the visual content of the t-shirt models.
- Provide users with the ability to download the resulting t-shirt model image as a PNG image, allowing them to share and save their custom designs.
- Ensure the website is responsive and optimized for all devices, providing a seamless experience to users regardless of the device they use.
